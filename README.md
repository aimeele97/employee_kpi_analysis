# HR Employee Performance Analysis

## Overview

This HR analytics project tackles three key issues: KPI performance, employee ratings, and recruitment channels. It provides insights and recommendations to help the HR department identify critical challenges, develop strategies to enhance KPI performance, improve employee ratings, and optimize recruitment processes.

## Data Source

The data for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle: [Employee Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanjanchaudhari/employees-performance-for-hr-analytics).

## List of Business Problems

After profiling, cleaning, and transforming the dataset, I analyzed employee demographics, including gender distribution, education levels, awards, age, departments, and KPI achievement rates. The analysis focuses on the following questions:

#### KPI Performance
1. What is the overall KPI achievement rate across the organization?
2. How do KPIs correlate with awards won by employees?
3. Which departments have the highest and lowest KPI performance?
4. What is the impact of training on KPI achievement?
5. How does the length of service affect KPI performance?
6. Which age groups achieve the highest KPIs?
7. How does education level relate to KPI performance?

#### Employee Ratings
1. What is the average employee rating within the company?
2. How do gender and department correlate with employee ratings?
3. Which department has the lowest average rating?
4. What percentage of low ratings (1 and 2 stars) come from specific departments?

#### Recruitment Channels
1. How many employees were hired through different recruitment channels?
2. What is the distribution of education levels across various recruitment sources? 
3. Are there any issues with "unknown" education levels affecting employee ratings?
