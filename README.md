# HR Employee Performance Analysis

## Overview

This HR analytics project addresses three key issues: KPI performance, employee satisfaction ratings, and recruitment channel effectiveness.

## Data Source

The data for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle: [Employee Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanjanchaudhari/employees-performance-for-hr-analytics).

## List of Problems

After profiling, cleaning, and transforming the dataset, I analyzed employee demographics, including gender distribution, education levels, awards, age, departments, and KPI achievement rates. The analysis focuses on the following questions:

### 1. KPI Analysis
- How do employees perform regarding KPIs and awards won?
- What impact do training sessions have on KPI achievement?
- How does length of service correlate with KPI performance?
- Which age groups perform best on KPIs?
- What is the relationship between education level and KPI achievement?

### 2. Company Ratings
- How do employees rate the company overall and by department and gender?

### 3. Recruitment Strategies
- What is the education distribution by recruitment channel and department?

## Key Findings

### 1. Gender Distribution
**Finding:** Male employees comprise over 50% of the workforce across all departments, with significant female representation in Procurement, HR, and Operations.  
**Recommendation:** Launch initiatives to attract and retain female talent in underrepresented areas through targeted recruitment and mentorship.

### 2. KPI Performance and Awards
**Finding:** R&D has the highest KPI achievement (45%) but only 1% of awards won, while Sales & Marketing has lower KPI achievement but the most awards.  
**Recommendation:** Align award criteria with KPI performance and enhance recognition of achievements in R&D.

### 3. Impact of Training
**Finding:** Training sessions vary in effectiveness regarding KPI achievement.  
**Recommendation:** Identify and promote successful training programs to improve overall employee performance.

### 4. Length of Service and Performance
**Finding:** Employees with 1 to 10 years of service achieve KPIs at rates of 30% to 40%, with performance declining thereafter.  
**Recommendation:** Enhance career development for long-tenured employees, including refresher training and mentorship.

### 5. Age Distribution
**Finding:** Employees aged 27 to 37 perform best on KPIs.  
**Recommendation:** Implement professional development programs for younger employees and engage older employees to improve performance.

### 6. Education Correlation
**Finding:** Employees with bachelorâ€™s degrees have the highest KPI performance.  
**Recommendation:** Expand educational support initiatives, such as tuition reimbursement, to encourage further education.

### 7. Company Ratings
**Finding:** The average employee rating is 3.35, with 18% rating their experience as 1 or 2, indicating dissatisfaction, particularly in Sales and Marketing.  
**Recommendation:** Conduct surveys to gather feedback on dissatisfaction and implement changes to improve job satisfaction.

### 8. Recruitment Effectiveness
**Finding:** Over half of employees were hired through various channels, but only 1.8% through referrals.  
**Recommendation:** Revamp the referral program and consider partnerships with recruitment agencies to enhance sourcing.

### 9. Education and Ratings
**Finding:** Employees with "unknown" education levels received the lowest ratings, indicating potential record-keeping issues.  
**Recommendation:** Investigate the reasons for "unknown" education levels and improve data collection processes.

## Overall Recommendation

Establish a continuous feedback loop with employees to gather insights and enhance organizational processes. Promoting a culture of transparency and engagement will lead to improved performance and employee satisfaction.
