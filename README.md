# HR Employee Performance Analysis

## Overview

This HR analytics project addresses three key issues: KPI performance, employee satisfaction ratings, and recruitment channel effectiveness.

## Data Source

The data for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle: [Employee Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanjanchaudhari/employees-performance-for-hr-analytics).

## List of Problems

After profiling, cleaning, and transforming the dataset, I analyzed employee demographics, including gender distribution, education levels, awards, age, departments, and KPI achievement rates. The analysis focuses on the following questions:

### 1. KPI Analysis
- How do employees perform regarding KPIs and awards won?
- What impact do training sessions have on KPI achievement?
- How does length of service correlate with KPI performance?
- Which age groups perform best on KPIs?
- What is the relationship between education level and KPI achievement?

### 2. Company Ratings
- How do employees rate the company overall and by department and gender?

### 3. Recruitment Strategies
- What is the education distribution by recruitment channel and department?
